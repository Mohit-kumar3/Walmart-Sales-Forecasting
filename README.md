# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting

• Walmart needed an accurate forecasting system to predict sales across multiple stores and departments, considering 
various factors such as holidays, promotions, and weather conditions. 
• Cleaned and preprocessed large datasets and visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
• Built a predictive Machine Learning model using Python (Scikit-learn) to forecast monthly sales with 85% accuracy.
